# jug_problem
This AI uses depth first and breadth first algorithms to solve a hypothetical problem, where the AI is trying to move water between three jugs so that each jug has a specific amount of. The jugs start containing a specified amount of water and the AI has to pour the water between the three jugs to find a set of actions that would yeild the expected final water distribution. Each jug has a max amount of water they can hold. The AI is then tested with different kinds of scenarios. 

The program is made in a jupyter notebook environment but it can be run as a .py in any other environment.
